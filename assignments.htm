                <h3><strong>Logo</strong> (10pts)</h3>
                <p><strong>Due: Wednesday 9/19</strong></p>
                <p>The logo is a mark, for the purposes of the assignment, such as we explored in the lecture yesterday. Think about the psychology of shape and color. What story does your mark tell about the agency, service, or product? You could consider the typography assignment complimentary - related to the graphic you develop for the logo - but you don't have to.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p>
                <p>Consider the campus office or club carefully to design a logo for. You should have a rationale to defend your design based on what the agency does, who is their audience, etc. There should be at least two versions of the logo - black and white, and color. You may choose to develop variations on the mark, or even submit competing designs, which is commonly done in industry. I recommend you review this article about the process of logo development:</p>
                <a href="http://www.adhamdannaway.com/blog/branding/a-systematic-approach-to-logo-design" target="_blank">A Systematic Approach To Logo Design</a>
                <p>This article provides good advice about designing a mark that has impact:</p>

                <p>You should familiarize yourself with raster and vector graphics tools, such as <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> and <strong>Illustrator</strong>, or <strong>GIMP</strong> and <strong>Inkscape</strong>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Due: Wednesday 9/26</strong></p>
                    <p>The typography assignment is similar to the logo design, in that you should consider the product, brand, service, or concept it represents and how your typographic design portrays that. What does your font choice say about your client? Who is the audience or user group, and what will appeal to them? Include a rationale for your design choices with your submission.</p>
                    <p>Render both a B &W and color version of your type design (max. width for upload to your is documentation is 720 px). Your final render can be either .png or .svg format. When your documentation has been updated, email the URL to <strong>uidev AT cs DOT stonybrook DOT edu</strong> with Type Design in the subject line.</p>
                    <p>Simplicity and clarity are paramount. Here are a couple of articles that discuss good typographic design:</p>

                    <p>You should also consider how your type design will affect other choices in a screen layout, like headers, subheads, captions, and body copy. What complimentary fonts work well with the choices you made for your type design? It's a standard practice in industry to create a type sampler, which shows how typography will be used throughout a document. Legibility is the primary consideration. Here is the corporate identity program for SBU, which gives an example:</p>

                    <h3><strong>Icon Set</strong> (10pts)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Due: Wednesday 10/3</strong></p>
                    <p>Your task is to develop a set of icons that share a theme, and adhere to best practices in terms of design. Your set of icons should be at least four, rendered in black and white, and also in color. The minimum size for each icon’s source file should be 1024 X 1024, though the file you embed in your documentation should be no more than 720 px wide.</p>
                    <p>The icons can relate to the logo you developed, and inherit the basic theme from that mark. That is probably a good idea, but not a requirement. You can develop a set of icons based on standard application navigation or features, such as “favorites” or “home”, “quit” or “submit”, etc; but your logo’s client may offer additional icon options such as “contact” or “directions”.</p>
                    <p>Remember that the main criteria of icons is simplicity, clarity, the ability to scale well, and recognizability. A ratio of 50/50 for positive to negative space is best. The set should share the same ground, be it square or circular.</p>
                    <p>The icon set can be rendered as either a .png or .svg file. I recommend developing the icons using a vector drawing tool such as Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape, because the files can subsequently be converted into a web font, as shown in class. Notes on the class demo can be found at </p>

                    <p><strong>Due: Wednesday 10/10</strong></p>
                    <p>The idea behind this exercise is to explore how animation can be used to engage users on a web site or in an application. It could be a splash screen that welcomes users to a site, or animated elements such as a logo or icons that add dynamics to an application.</p>
                    <p>You can either develop an animation in HTML5 and CSS3 (e.g. using Google Web Designer) or create an animated GIF or series of GIFs (e.g. using Photoshop). It’s likely that extending the look and feel of the graphics you have already developed is a good idea, but it’s not required.</p>
                    <p>Here are some resources you may find useful:</p>
                    <p>Download GWD</p>

                    <p>If you do a splash screen, 3 - 5 seconds of animation should be sufficient. The animation can loop, of course, possibly with a link to load a web site, as shown in class. If you do an animated GIF, or a series of GIFs, the animation(s) should probably loop indefinitely, and should have a transparent background.</p>
                    <p>If you are using GWD, remember to publish the animation locally, and then move that directory to your Sites folder on the lab’s fileserver, so you can link to the index page of your animation from your documentation. If you are creating an animated GIF(s) then you can embed them as images right in your documentation (maximum width is 720 px).</p>

                    <p><strong>Due: Wednesday 10/17</strong></p>
                    <p>The purpose of this assignment is to work with a dataset to visualize it for a particular audience. The infographic could be editorial in nature (such as exploring the effects of climate change), or it could be promotional (such as a company touting its sales and market share statistics).</p>
                    <p>This site has links to a variety of data sources you may find interesting:</p>
                    <a href="https://www.columnfivemedia.com/100-best-free-data-sources-infographic" target="_blank">www.columnfivemedia.com/100-best-free-data-sources-infographic</a>
                    <p>The trick is to find the most compelling data for your audience, extract it, and feature it in a way that is engaging.</p>
                    <p>The criteria for a good infographic is that it should “make the numbers come alive”. The layout of the elements should have a good balance, with some important features highlighted. There should be a graphic consistency to the design elements and typography. A visual theme should emerge from the design that is appropriate to the data and to your audience. Here is a good article about best design practices for infographics:</p>
                    <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/28436/10-Traits-of-Amazingly-Awesome-Infographics.aspx" target="_blank">blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/28436/10-Traits-of-Amazingly-Awesome-Infographics.aspx</a>
                    <p>This site provides a very good synopsis of Edward Tufte’s design principles applied to graphics and the web:</p>
                    <a href="http://staff.washington.edu/larryg/Classes/R560/zz-tufte.html" target="_blank">staff.washington.edu/larryg/Classes/R560/zz-tufte.html</a>
                    <p>As per the demo in class, you should use a vector graphics tool to create the infographic, such as Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape. I recommend a standard letter size (8.5 X 11 in) at 300 ppi. You should work in layers, where each datapoint and its associated graphic or chart is on a separate layer. In Illustrator you can export the file as svg or png formats. If you export the infographic as a png file at 72 ppi, the rendered file will be 614 X 794, which is a good size to display in your documentation.</p>

                    <p><strong>Due: Wednesday 10/31</strong></p>
                    <p>The purpose of this assignment is gather content for a web-based application that will adapt its display to multiple platforms and orientations, such as mobile or desktop, portrait or landscape. The subject of your app should provide graphics (such as a logo, icons, or display typography); text about the agency, product, or service; photographs, and possibly video and other content. </p>
                    <p>How will you tell the story? What will be your focal points? How will your layout organize the content to make it both accessible and engaging for the user? How will you tie everything together thematically?</p>
                    <p>There are two possible approaches to the development of the web-based app: fluid grid and JQuery Mobile. The fluid grid lends itself more to editorial types of content (online magazines, etc.), and jquery lends itself more to mobile apps. Choose the one that best reflects your content. Resources for mastering those techniques are linked below, including step-by-step notes from my class demo.</p>

                    <p><strong>Due: Wednesday 11/14</strong></p>
                    <p>Your task is to mock-up a start screen and one game level (at a minimum) for a 3D game . The type of game, FPS, RPG, flight sim, puzzle, etc. is up to you. You should consider the target audience demographic (eg. kids vs adults) and design the look and feel of the UI accordingly. The UI should have a pervasive theme throughout, from typography to navigation to user controls, that adds to the game narrative.</p>
                    <p>The nominal size would be 1024 X 768 px (for tablet-based games) but could be higher (say, 1600 X1200) for console-type games. For display in your documentation, however, the screens should be scaled to 720 px wide.</p>
                    <p>It’s recommended you use the graphic and 3d capabilities of Photoshop to create your mock-up, but it is not required. It’s OK to use free geometries available on the web to mock-up the game world and game characters, but the UI elements should be original. The file formats that Photoshop CS6 can read are 3ds and obj. Downloaded files may be archived using zip or rar, so you might need a utility to unarchive the files.</p>
                    <p>Here is a good place to search for free 3d models:<p>

                    <p>In Photoshop, as demonstrated in class, you can combine 2d layers, such as photo backgrounds, with 3d objects. You can also extrude 2d layers, such as text, into 3d layers. 3d objects can be scaled, rotated, and moved in all dimensions. With the Move tool selected, the 3D manipulators appear along the top of the workspace. You can also apply materials and texture maps to parts of the model, as well as paint directly on the mesh. To create a new 3d layer by importing a 3ds or obj file, choose 3D &gt; New 3D Layer from File. To merge 3d objects into a single scene and coordinate system, choose 3D &gt; Merge 3D Layers.</p>
                    <p>A new tab will appear alongside the Layers palette, called 3D. In that tab you can select meshes, faces, camera, lights, and scene properties. Properties for any of these can be set in the properties panel above. In the Layers palette, the 3d object shares all the same properties as 2d layers, such as opacity and layer effects.</p>
                    <p>You can export your Photoshop file as a 3d object by choosing 3D &gt; Export 3D Layer. You can render your file using 3D &gt; Render, and then save the file as a png.</p>
                    <p>Here’s a basic introduction to 3D in Photoshop:</p>

                    <h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>
                    <p>Project documentation should be updated regularly throughout the semester. The presentation should be easy to navigate and professional. Don't waste time embellishing the project web site with decorative graphics. Think of presenting each assignment as a tutorial of how you did the project.</p>
                    <p><strong>Important Note: </strong>All students are required to present their final projects in class the last week of the semester. Students must submit a CD with all of the source for the exercises and projects.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Grading</strong></h3>
                    <p>The work for the course is expected to be developed iteratively, so grades posted when assignments are due are advisory grades, and can be improved upon with refinement in the final presentation.</p>
                    <p>The general criteria for grading all assignments is 40% for meeting assignment specifications, 40% for technical proficiency, and 20% for innovation. Late submissions will have points deducted (1 point per day). Projects with content that is offensive or defamatory will have points deducted, or may get no credit at all. Plagiarized work will recieve no credit, and may be reported to the academic judiciary.</p>
                    <p>Only two unexscused absences are allowed for the term. Subsequent absences may result in the loss of a grade point per absence (i.e. from an A- to a B+).</p>
                    <p>A grade of &quot;I&quot; (incomplete) for the semester is rarely given.</p>
                    <p>No assignments will be accepted after class has ended on the last day of class for the semester.</p>
